- 👋 Hi, I’m @nizz0k
- 👀 I’m interested in geography and geographic tools, street art, and verbal and visual communication.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a bit of Python, keeping my front end languages at the point where I don't look stuff up all the time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on maps and frameworks?
- 📫 How to reach me: I dunno, does this have a chat?
